# AI-ML-DL-practice

This repository contains notebooks implementing different AI-ML-DL algorithms.

## Datasets
  - [Plant dataset](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/tree/main/dataset/plant-dataset)

## Algorithms

 - [Decision Trees](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/blob/main/Decision%20Trees.ipynb):
Scratch implementation of Decision Trees algorithm on Play Golf dataset. Calculates entropy and gain for each attribute. Then builds a tree. Predictor function also created to test the model.

- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/blob/main/Naive%20Bayes.ipynb):
Scratch implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm on a small employee dataset. Calculates prior and conditional probablities. Also uses laplace smoothing. Prediction function made for test cases.

- [K Nearst Neighbors](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/blob/main/k%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb):
Scratch implementation of kNN algorthim on plant dataset. Uses euclidean distance to find distance between neighbors. Comparison with Sklearn.neighbors done to compare accuracy.

- [XOR Gate Neural Network](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/blob/main/OR%20Neural%20Network.ipynb):
Scratch implementation of neural network that trains for an OR gate. 

- [Multi-Class Classification NN](https://github.com/abdulrahmanjawad/AI-ML-DL-practice/blob/main/Multi_class_Classification_NN.ipynb):
A neural network made to classify plant category after input of plant leaf dimensions. Uses plant dataset. Dataset is first processed using StandardScalar and OneHotEncoder from Sklearn. An NN model is then made using TensorFlow and Keras.
